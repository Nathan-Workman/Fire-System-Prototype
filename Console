The Console.sh file is the main code that enables the sensors and alarms to communicate in order to keep you safe from fire.
The alarm will sound and sprinklers will turn on  when your main system detects a temperature greater than 130 and the subsystem detects a temperature greater than 100.
If there is an error in the subsystem's detection the alarm and sprinklers will turn on.
The alarm and sprinklers can be turned off by pressing the bottom button.

In order to test your software hold the top button for 3 seconds or until you hear the alarm.
To stop the alarm press the button below it until the sound stops.
This test will turn on your alarm and sprinkler lights.

Note: FIRE = BAD (Do not approach)
