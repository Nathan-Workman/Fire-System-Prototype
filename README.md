# Fire-System-Prototype
Fire alarm system prototype using UNIX scripting on the Raspberry Pi
The project has two different types of files, the extension files with a .py/.sh are the actual code and the others are documentation for each.
The main console was in charge of running  the two seperate code files, that are AdaFruit and the temp.
The temp.sh runs the temperture sensor and passes the reading back to the main console.
The AdaFruit.py was a backupfile for the temperture sensor, in case of a bug was present.
The log file logged all tested runs of the prototype, as well as if a fire was present.
